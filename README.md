## NEWS
**2024-05-14**: Our paper got early acceptance by MICCAI 2024!!!

## Abstract

> Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm to extract discriminative feature representations within Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology. Despite driving notable progress, existing MIL approaches suffer from limitations in facilitating comprehensive and efficient interactions among instances, as well as challenges related to time-consuming computations and overfitting. In this paper, we incorporate the Selective Scan Space State Sequential Model (Mamba) in Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for long sequence modeling with linear complexity, termed as MambaMIL. By inheriting the capability of vanilla Mamba, MambaMIL demonstrates the ability to comprehensively understand and perceive long sequences of instances. Furthermore, we propose the Sequence Reordering Mamba (SR-Mamba) aware of the order and distribution of instances, which exploits the inherent valuable information embedded within the long sequences. With the SR-Mamba as the core component, MambaMIL can effectively capture more discriminative features and mitigate the challenges associated with overfitting and high computational overhead. Extensive experiments on two public challenging tasks across nine diverse datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework performs favorably against state-of-the-art MIL methods. 

## NOTES
**2024-04-12**: For subsequent updates of the paper, We will update the arixv version in next month.

**2024-04-13**: We released the model of MambaMIL. The whole training code is coming soon.

**2024-04-24**: We released the full version of MambaMIL, including models and train scripts.

## How to Train
### Prepare your data
1. Download diagnostic WSIs from [TCGA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and [BRACS](https://www.bracs.icar.cnr.it/) 
2. Use the WSI processing tool provided by [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM) to extract resnet-50 and [PLIP](https://github.com/PathologyFoundation/plip/tree/main) pretrained feature for each 512 $\times$ 512 patch (20x), which we then save as `.pt` files for each WSI. So, we get one `pt_files` folder storing `.pt` files for all WSIs of one study.

The final structure of datasets should be as following:
```bash
DATA_ROOT_DIR/
    └──pt_files/
        └──resnet50/
            ├── slide_1.pt
            ├── slide_2.pt
            └── ...
        └──plip/
            ├── slide_1.pt
            ├── slide_2.pt
            └── ...
        └──others/
            ├── slide_1.pt
            ├── slide_2.pt
            └── ...
```
### Survival Prediction

```bash
model_names='max_mil mean_mil att_mil trans_mil s4_mil mamba_mil'
